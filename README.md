# Introduction

This is a project I created as part of a job interviewing process.

# How to quickly run:

- It's deployed to [https://2021-job-search-w-coding-assignment-7zvmjhrgg.vercel.app/](https://2021-job-search-w-coding-assignment-7zvmjhrgg.vercel.app/), you can conveniently run it there.

# How to test or develop

- Check out the source code from the [repo](https://github.com/vdavid/2021-job-search-w-coding-assignment)
- Run `npm install` in the app folder
- Run the app for development with `npm run dev`, then see it at http://localhost:3000
- Run tests by `npm run tests`
- As for the source code, you're probably interested in the algorithms in **/services/Problem1Solver.ts**.

## Project description

### Problem

I was expected to:

- Develop my solution for at least one of 2 problems, as if I was shipping it to production
- Use any language
- Attach tests
- Add docs to facilitate understanding and running
- Ensure that I follow the requirements, and that the code works
- Make the code robust, well-written, easy to follow, and maintainable
- Provide the answers for my chosen question in the problemX.txt file
- Add code and comments to set up and to run my solution
- Can submit both assignments
- Send the results back in an archive

### Solution

- I chose the first problem
- For the language, I chose TypeScript.
- I added Next.js for the convenience of the reviewer so that I can deploy it via Vercel. Clicking a link seems more convenient for the reviewer to see the output than checking out the app from the repo, doing an `npm install`, and running it from a CLI.

# Tech details
 - I've bootstrapped my app with `npx create-next-app@latest --ts`
