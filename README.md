# Introduction

This is a project I created as part of a job interviewing process.

# Running
- Run the app for development with `npm run dev`, then see it at http://localhost:3000

## Project description

### Problem

I was expected to:

- Develop my solution for at least one of 2 problems, as if I was shipping it to production
- Use any language
- Attach tests
- Add docs to facilitate understanding and running
- Ensure that I follow the requirements, and that the code works
- Make the code robust, well-written, easy to follow, and maintainable
- Provide the answers for my chosen question in the problemX.txt file
- Add code and comments to set up and to run my solution
- Can submit both assignments
- Send the results back in an archive

### Solution

- I chose TypeScript, plus Next.js to bootstrap the app. It's quick and pretty standard this way, plus it can be deployed to the web via Netlify or Vercel. Clicking a link seems more convenient for the reviewer than running it from a CLI.

# Tech details
 - I've bootstrapped my app with `npx create-next-app@latest --ts`
