# Introduction

This is a project I created as part of a job interviewing process.

I was expected to:

- Develop it as if I was shipping it to production
- Use any language
- Attach tests
- Add docs to facilitate understanding and running
- Ensure that I follow the requirements, and that the code works
- Make the code robust, well-written, easy to follow, and maintainable
- Provide the answers for my chosen question in the problemX.txt file
- Add code and comments to set up and to run my solution
- Can submit both assignments
- Send the results back in an archive

# Tech details
 - I've bootstrapped my app with `npx create-next-app@latest --ts` because it's quick and pretty standard, plus it sets up the project in a way that it can be deployed to the web via Netlify or Vercel. Just clicking a link is probably slightly more convenient for the reviewer than running it from a CLI.
