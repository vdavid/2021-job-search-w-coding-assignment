Problem 2
2.a

The input provided in the file input2.txt consists of lines with the following format:

n-n c: str

where n is a digit, c is a character and str is a string.

Each line defines a constraint for a string and the string itself. The constraint (n-n c) indicates the lowest and highest number of times a given letter can appear in the string for it to be valid.

In the example input below, 2 strings are valid. The middle string, cdefg, is not; it contains no instances of b, but needs at least 1. The first and third strings are valid: they contain one a or nine c, both meeting their defined constraint.

1-3 a: abcde
1-3 b: cdefg
2-9 c: ccccccccc

How many strings meet the constraint in the input2.txt file provided?

Answer:

2.b

Suppose we change the meaning of the constraint to define the positions the letter may appear in the string. Exactly one of these positions must contain the given letter.

Using the example above:

- 1-3 a: abcde is valid: position 1 contains a and position 3 does not
- 1-3 b: cdefg is invalid: neither position 1 nor position 3 contains b
- 2-9 c: ccccccccc is invalid: both position 2 and position 9 contain c

How many strings meet the constraint in the input2.txt file with the modified constraint?

Answer:
